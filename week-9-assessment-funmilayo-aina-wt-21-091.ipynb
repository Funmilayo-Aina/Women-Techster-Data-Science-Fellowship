A view also has rows and columns as they are in a real table in the database. We can create a view by selecting fields from one or more tables present in the database. A View can either have all the rows of a table or specific rows based on certain condition.  A VIEW is simply a data object which contains no data. Its contents are the resultant of the base table. They are operated just like the base table but they don’t contain any data of their own.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 15:What is an Index?\n##### Answer: The indexes are special objects which built on top of tables. The indexes can do an operation like SELECT, DELETE and UPDATE statement faster to manipulate a large amount of data. An INDEX can also be called a table and it has a data structure. An INDEX is created on columns of a table. One table may contain one or more INDEX tables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 16A:.

Each table can only have one clustered index.\n\nNon-Clustered Index:\n\nNon-Clustered Index does not alter the physical order of the table and maintains a logical order of the data. Each table can have many nonclustered indexes.\n\nUnique Index:\nThis index does not allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed. If a primary key is defined, a unique index can be applied automatically.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 17:What is a Cursor?\nA cursor in SQL is a temporary work area created in system memory when a SQL statement is executed.

A Stored Procedure can be used as a modular programming which means create once, store and call for several times whenever it is required. This supports faster execution. It also reduces network traffic and provides better security to the data\n\nUses for stored procedures include data-validation or access-control mechanisms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 23: What is a trigger?\n##### Answer:  A SQL trigger is a database object which fires when an event occurs in a database.

DELETE deletes records one by one and makes an entry for each and every deletion in the transaction log, whereas The truncate command deletes rows by deallocating the pages.\n\nTruncate always removes rows from a table,leaving the table empty and structure intact whereas delete may remove conditionally if the where clause is used. The rows deleted by Truncate statement cannot be restored and you cannot specify where clause in Truncate statment. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 25:\nWhat are local and global variables and their differences?\n##### Answers: Variables are classified into Global variables and Local variables based on their scope. The main difference between Global and local variables is that global variables can be accessed globally in the entire program, whereas local variables can be accessed only within the function or block in which they are defined.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 26: What is a constraint?\n##### Answer:\nSQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table. Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.\n\nConstraints are simply the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Question 27: What is data Integrity?\n##### Answers: Data Integrity is used to maintain accuracy and consistency of data in a table.
